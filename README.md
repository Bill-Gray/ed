Text editor (probably of interest only to me)
---------------------------------------------

In 1992,  as a young and independent programmer,  I made a remarkably
dumb move.  I'd been working for a shop that used the KEDIT text editor,
but now that I was self-employed,  I didn't want to shell out for my own
copy (I think it would have been a few hundred bucks).  I don't recall what
free alternatives were available in DOS at the time,  but in any case,  one
does get very accustomed to a particular editor,  and it's hard to change.
So I wrote my own KEDIT clone.  I'm still using it.  You,  if you have any
sense whatsoever,  will not.

For me,  this editor ('be',  as in "Bill's Editor") has two advantages.
First,  I'm already used to it.  Second,  if I need to modify it,  I know
how the source code works and can do so easily.  You have neither of these
advantages.  And most of the source code was written about twenty years ago,
when I was young and stupid (did I mention that writing my own editor was
a dumb idea?)  Go elsewhere.   Go watch cat videos or something.  It's a
big Internet out there.  Shoo!
