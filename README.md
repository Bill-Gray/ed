Text editor (probably of interest only to me)
---------------------------------------------

In 1992,  as a young and independent programmer,  I made a remarkably dumb move.  I'd been working for a shop that used the [Mansfield KEDIT text editor](https://www.kedit.com), but now that I was self-employed,  I didn't want to shell out for my own copy (I think it would have been a few hundred bucks).  I don't recall what free alternatives were available in DOS at the time,  but in any case,  one does get very accustomed to a particular editor, and it's hard to change. So I wrote my own KEDIT clone.  I'm still using it.  You, if you have any sense whatsoever,  will not.

For me,  this editor ('be',  as in "Bill's Editor") has two big advantages. First and most major,  I was already used to KEDIT,  and replicated the bits from it that I actually used.  Second,  if I need to modify it,  I know how the source code works and can do so easily.  (Early on,  I did this to allow me to use the editor on Linux, and,  since then,  on FreeBSD.  The "original" KEDIT is DOS/Windows only.  It also handles CR/LF vs. LF endings correctly,  which KEDIT didn't.)

You have none of these advantages.  And most of the source code was written about twenty years ago, when I was young and stupid (did I mention that writing my own editor was a dumb idea?)  So the code is embarrassingly ugly.  Go elsewhere.   Go watch cat videos or something.  It's a big Internet out there;  you've better things to do than look at this.  Shoo!
